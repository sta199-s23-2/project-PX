The objective of the study is to display the differences between women’s and men’s basketball in funding and revenue output, so in doing that we believed creating a bar graph would allow the audience to visualize the size of the difference (double or even triple). Furthermore, grouping the data by each college in the ACC is very important because every program has different user bases and revenue streams so the viewer can take into account the colleges marketing. For example, Duke basketball generates a ton of revenue from their brand as they recruit the top high school recruits, giving the viewer a context of why Duke’s difference between men’s and women’s is larger than the rest of the ACC. Lastly, we focused on mean data rather than median data as we compared the average expenses and revenues of college programs during the 2020 and 2021 year as it is a more accurate measure of comparison."

The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis (calculate every possible statistic and perform every possible procedure for all variables). Rather, you should demonstrate that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them using data, that you are skilled in interpreting and presenting results, and that you can accomplish these tasks using R. More is not better.\n\n“How do men’s college basketball revenues and expenses compare to women’s college basketball revenues and expenses?”\nOverview of Results:\nFrom analyzing the bar graphs we can notice when looking at Average Revenue in the ACC for Men’s vs Women’s Basketball in 2020-2021, the men’s programs in every ACC college produce more revenue. At Duke, the men’s program produced over $30 million in revenue while the women’s program produces less than $5 million. Every college in the ACC has their men’s basketball program producing over double of their women’s team except University of Miami and Clemson University. We are able to infer that Men’s basketball programs in the ACC produce more than women’s by a high margin. Boston college, NC state, and Syracuse Women’s basketball programs produce less than $2 million.\nTo look at the second part of the question we have to look at the bar graph for men’s and women’s programs expenses. We can see that the expenses for all men’s basketball programs are higher than women’s. However, only Duke, Syracuse, and Louisville men’s programs have expenses that are more than double than the women’s programs. The expenses for all the women’s teams are also higher than the revenues. For example, Unc chapel hill’s women’s team generated roughly $1 million in revenue in 2020-2021, but had roughly $5 million in expenses that year. The Duke men’s program had the highest expenses at almost $20 million, but still produced over $30 million in revenue so they were still profitable."
