This data came from Equity in Athletics Data Analysis (EADA). It was collected through mandatory reports from post-secondary institutions that receive Title IX funding. The data was collected from 2020 and 2021. The data is looking as equity in college athletics by comparing different aspects of male and female sports. This specific dataset is looking at all schools in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Data was collected on multiple variables including the number of male and female athletes, the number of male and female coaches, and the revenue of male and female sports. There is also information on coaching salaries. There are no ethical concerns we foresee arising.

## Methodology

**Note: don't use co-ed, the four variables looked at are "Revenues.Men.s.Team" vs "Revenues.Men.s.Team" and "Expenses.Men.s.Team" vs "Expenses.Men.s.Team"**

1\) summary statistics: calculating average between 2020 and 2021 for each school in each metric (i.e., revenue and expenses)

2\) Visualizations: bar graph of men's vs women's revenue faceted by school; bar graph of men's vs women's expenses faceted by school

3\) Justify the choice of statistical method(s) used to answer your research question
